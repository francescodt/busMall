# busMall
(Sky)BusMall site.

This is an application that shows product to any viewers and has them vote on a random table of images presented to them. That data is then extrapolated to show what is the most common selected product based on what was viewed and voted on. 

The images are random, and will not take up more than one spot at a time. The data is also saved from user to user using local storage to give back a complete total of all the votes amongst users.
